# Quick Install guide for the VL-e Toolkit (VLET) 
#

How to install:
==== 
 1) unpack or unzip (you probably already did this) 
  
 2) Run the following command:
   
    - Windows: start bin/vbrowser.exe 
   
    - Linux/Unix: start bin/vbrowser.sh for any UNIX
    
    - Other: You can start the vbrowser jar directly by using the command:
     
        java -jar vbrowser.jar
 
Installation requirements: 
===
 - Java Requirements: Java 1.6 (or compatible) is needed to run the toolkit. 
   
   For java downloads see: 
	  http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp 
  
   If you don't know which java version to download, select 'Jre 1.6'
   
 - Java compatibility issues: 
   Only SUN Java is supported. Other Java versions like 'gcj' and 
   'OpenJDK' are known to have numerous bugs regarding UI Applications. 
  
 - You need a grid certificate to contact grid servers 
   See: http://certificate.nikhef.nl/request/
  
  For more descriptive installation instructions see the UserGuide
  in the 'doc' directory of this installation.
 
  
Configuring your certificate environment: 
===
 - Make sure your personal certificate is in your HOME environment: 
   For linux, this location is: 
  
      $HOME/.globus 
      
   For windows XP this location could be: 
  
      c:\WINNT\profiles\(Your User Name)\.globus

   You can also use the VBrowser to check the location of
   your HOME on windows. Just start the VBrowser, and look for the folder
   which has a mini house (home) icon in it. 
   It should be the first or one of the first folder icons under the MyVle
   icon.
   You can create a new directory ".globus" and copy your grid certificate
   to that directory. After that you can create a Grid Proxy by clicking on 
   the keys icon in the VBrowser. The VBrowser doesn't have to be restarted. 
   
     
Adding host certificates or 'root CA' certificates 
=== 
 - Currently the host and root CA certificates in VLET_INSTALL/etc/certificates 
   are loaded when starting the browser. 
   These are not visible in the COG certificates configuration wizard as this 
   tool configures the global COG environment and not the VBrowser.
   
 - For NIKHEF/DutchGrid hosts, nothing has to be done, but if you want
   to access other Grid servers which have different CAs, add the (root) 
   CA certificates to the etc/certificates directory of this installation. 
   These will be loaded automatically at startup.
 
 - You can add custom CA certificates to either VLET_INSTALL/etc/certificates 
   or to $HOME/.vletrc/certificates 
    
    
Configuring a new Resource
===
 - If no Storage Locations are present in the "MyVLe" icon, right-click on MyVle,
   and select: New-> <Type> Location, where <Type> is any supported file protocol. 

 - To configure this new Resource, right click on the Server icon
   and select "Properties". 
   Fill in the appropriate values at the "Server Configuration" tab.
