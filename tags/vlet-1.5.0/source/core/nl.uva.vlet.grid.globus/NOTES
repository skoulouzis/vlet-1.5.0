## 
# Module: grid.globus 
##
# Info: 
#   Legacy Globus 4.1 code.  
#   Moved to own project to reduce dependencies into Globus 4.1  
#   Contains Proxy Provider, VOMSifier and legacy OGSA and GLOBUS 
#   transport stack initialization code. 
# 
# Version: 
#   Since 1.3.0 
#

By extracting the globus code into a separate (software) module, vrs.core is now 
independent of the used globus version.
Upon initialization the globus proxy provider and transport stack needs to be registered
for the globus code to be of effect. 

Structure
===
- globus_src ; alternative globus initalization source (legacy 4.1 code) 
- lib/globus-4.1 	; contain globus jars not found in cog-jglobus.
