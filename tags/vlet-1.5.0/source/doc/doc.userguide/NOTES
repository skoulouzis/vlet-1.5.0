About this component:
=== 
    Type 'make' or 'ant' to compile the document.  
    GNU make and LaTeX as pdflatex are needed by this component. 
    A typical linux distro should have these commands avaliable.
    
        
Note to Developers: 
=== 
 - Images: 
    Do note resize the images to make them smaller in the document. 
    Use the 'scale' or 'width' option in LaTeX, because print resolution
    is usually much higher then screen resolution. 
 - screenshots can easily be acquired by using gimp and go to the menu: 
    File->Acquire->Screenshot. DO NOT SAVE AS JPG, use PNG instead. 
 - Compression: 
    Do not use lossy compression formats like JPG. On screen they might
    look ok, but when printed the JPG noise (artifacts) are visable. 
    (Exceptions might be made for large high resolution pictures >300dpi) 
 - Do not forget to commit GIF/PNG files as 'binary'. 
 - Image conversion: 
    The Makefile contains implicit pattern rules to convert all pictures  
    in the 'images' directory to 'eps' (for latex) or 'pdf' (for pdflatex).
    Add extra patterns for other formats if needed (.bmp/.png). 
    Just use the filename WITHOUT EXTENTION in the LaTeX document and put the GIF/PNG
    file in 'images/' to autoconvert it (latex and pdflatex will append the
    right extension to it).
 - Viewing: 
    You can view the PDF file in the 'dist' directory or view the DVI file
    in the build directory, which also contains the EPS files. 

TODO:
===
  - hypertextify the resulting PDF and create HTML 
  - add VL-e housestyle (Verdana fonts,section headers,etc)
