How to include images in your tex document 
=== 
To include images into your tex document, do not specify a suffix to it in the \includegraphics command. 
LaTeX is smart enough to get the right suffix. Also pdflatex needs .pdf images and latex
itself needs .eps images.  

A typical include statement in your latex document is: 

 \begin{figure}[htbp]
 \centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{image_name}}
 \caption{My Image}
 \label{fig:my_image}
 \end{figure}
