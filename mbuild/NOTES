    Project    : VL-e Toolkit
    Component  : mbuild 
    Maintainer : P.T. de Boer (PTdB) 
    
    Info:
        VL-e root build component (or metabuild component) 
        This is the root configuration component which builds the 
        other components.
        
==============================================================================
        
Component Structure: 
===
    build.xml           Main ant build file. 
    configuration.xml   Configuration file. Contains components, cvs structure 
                        and versions      
    distributions.xml   Distribution targets 
    doCompononent.xml   Component related targets
    [dist/]             Project distribution directory 
    project.prop        Default project properties 
    [build.prop]        Customized (local/host specific) settings
    [vletpacks]         Distribution zipfiles and build environment. 

Note to Developers: 
=== 
    - ant 1.6.5+ is needed to use the ant files 
    - To be able to call the components build.xml from within the component, 
      you need to define the 'project.root' property which MUST point to 
      the absolute location of this component as follows:
      
          ant -Dproject.root=<mbuild directory> 
          
   - Most project variables (-D<var>=<value> ) can be set in local.prop. 
     Customize this file to match with you personal (=local) build environment. 

      
About this component 
===
    The general way invoke ant and use this build.xml file is : 
        
        ant <ant-options> <ant-target> [ -D<project-variable> [ -D<project-variable>...]] 
    
    For the ant options use 'ant --help'
    
    Current defined toplevel targets: 
        <nothing>            no arguments: default target = project-install 
                             (uses defaults from project.prop file!) 
        dist-install         build+install core components using mbuild defaults 
        dist-install-all     build+install all components (including modules) using mbuild defaults 
        vlet-install         build+install 'vlet' components using mbuild defaults  
        dist-clean           clean all components, recurses into components 
        clean		         clean mbuild, does not recurse into components.
         
	Source targets: 
	    source-dist          prepare components for a source release. 
	    
    Releases and distribution targets (distribution.xml) :      

        build-current        checkout latest + build vlet 'core' components snapshot in 'vletpacks'
        build-all-current    checkout latest + build vlet ALL components (core+modules)  in 'vletpacks'
        build-release        build latest (versioned) 'core' release. 
        build-all-release    build latest (versioned) 'all' release. 

    Source Releases (distribution.xml): 

        build-source-current   create source release from latest from SCM HEAD. 
        build-source-release   create latest stable source release. 
        
    Component targets:    
        doComponent -Dname=<component> -Dtarget=<component-target>
        
    Definable project-variables are:
        
        -Dproject.sourcedir=<component parent dir> - parent directory to checkout/find the components
        -Dproject.dist=<install-dir>             - ABSOLUTE PATH of project dist or installation directory                                

    Examples:
    ===  
    - To build the whole project type: 
        ant 
        
    - To clean the whole project type: 
        ant clean 
        
    - build  'current' distribution  in ./dist
        ant dist-install

    - build  'current' distribution + modules  in ./dist
        ant dist-install-all
        
    - To build/clean a separate component type: 
        ant doComponent -Dname=<component> -Dtarget=dist-install 
        ant doComponent -Dname=<component> -Dtarget=clean

    - Invoke the build file from a component invoke ant as follows: 
    
        ant -Dproject.root=<absolute path of mbuild dir>  [ <component-target> ] 

      for example in the frontend component (to compile it) :
        
          [frontend_dir]$ ant -Dproject.root=../mbuild dist 


	Build release from SVN: 
	
    - checkout and build  'current' distribution from SCM in ./vletpacks 
        ant build-current
