# Project   : VL-e Toolkit (VLeT) 
# Component : vrs.tests 
# Author    : Piter T. de Boer 

Info
=== 
 Unit tests and test suites for the VL-e Toolkit. 
 Most test are execution from within the eclipse environment by selecting 
 a class from the test.junit.vrs package. 
 The './bin' directory does contain some ant+script files to 
 test a distribution, but these are not maintained very much.  
	
Tests
===
 - test.junit : default unit test classes + configuration, may contain 
	            abstract classes which must be subclassed
 - test.junit.regression : regression tests to test whether exotic bugs in the 
                APIs  (3rd party or my own) are still there or not. 	            
 - test.junit.vrs : set of unit tests to test the VRS/VFS,
 			    run these classes to do the  actual testing. 
 - testSuites/TextConfiguration : 
                currently hardcoded test settings. 


Run a test
===	
 To run a test, select one of the Test Suites from test.junit.vrs. 
 From eclipse select: "Run As" -> "JUnit test" or
 run "Run As" -> "Java Application"
 Some tests might need configuration/authentication to access 
 remote resources.
