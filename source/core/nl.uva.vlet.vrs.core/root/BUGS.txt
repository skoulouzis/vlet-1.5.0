# Known bugs and unimplemented features 


Unimplemented features 
=== 
- Dragging a file from a remote location (SRB/GFTP) onto the Windows desktop 
  (or another Windows/KDE location) fails (The URI is pasted as text). 
  This is because Java DnD (Drag and Drop) to the native windows environment
  only accepts files which exist on the local filesystem. 
  How to intercept this DnD operation is currently unknown. 
  Dropping a local file onto a remote location works and is similar to an 'upload'
  to that remote location. 

   
Known Bugs - All platforms: 
===    
- When creating two resources with the same server URI: <scheme>://host:port 
  they will share the same server configuration settings. 
  This because the VBrowser is URI oriented can can not distinguish between two
  different server configurations for the same Server Location (or URI).
  The VFS API does support multiple server configurations. 


Known Bugs - Windows: 
===    
- "No disk in drive error" when starting the VBrowser. 
  When scanning for the filesystem roots, java creates this error. 
  Just press cancel in the message dialog. 
  
  Current Workaround: 
  
  There is now an option in the MyVLe resource to skip the floppy 
  scan. Right-click on MyVle, select 'Properties' and set
  the property 'skipFloppyScan' to 'true'.
  This is default set to 'true'.
