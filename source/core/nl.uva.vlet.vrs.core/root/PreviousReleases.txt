 Release notes for 1.4.1/1.4.0 
======================================================================

This is a bugfix release.
But I 
Updates:
===
- Fixed the asynchronous srmLs bug. The SRM API now supports asynchronous 
  polling enabled in newer versions of dCache.  
- Added extra 'srmCount' and 'srmOffset' parameters to SRM VRLs. 
  This way an SRM directory with more then 1000 entries can be listed using urils.sh 
  as follows:  
  
     urils.sh srm://srm.grid.sara.nl:8443/data/pvier/ptdeboer/bigdir?srmCount=100&srmOffset=200  

=== Release notes for 1.4.0 ===

Features
===
- Script urils.sh -l <uri> now also works if <uri> isn't a directory but a plain file.
- Script uristat.sh also works on non file resources.   
- The navigation bar now has a completion "combo" box which remembers typed in locations. 
- Added support for certificate files ending with ".crt". Clicking on them will
  start a Certificate Viewer which ask the user if the certificate needs to be 
  imported into the trusted certificate store. 
  Right clicking on a .crt file will show a "certs" submenu with certificate options. 
- When browsing an SSH location, a VLterm can be started directly with the new menu 
  option "Open VLTerm".  
- Prototype implementation of iRods plugin. Supports only minimal file browsing
  and up- and downloading.  
  No optimization nor iRods specific features have been implemented. 

Bug fixes:
===
- Fixed bugs which could occur when viewing similar resources in the ResourceTree. 
  Both subtrees should now be updated correctly.
- Changing the VO field of a proxy will now trigger a connection reset so the new 
  VO of the new proxy will be used.    
- Added new Terena root CA certificate to the default certificate store. 
  Some dutchgrid sites use this new (root) certificate. 
- For an overview of all bug fixes see the bug tracker.

 1.3.x Release Notes 
======================================================================
 
   
=== Release notes for 1.3.2 ===

Updates:  
===
- LFC replica methods have been improved and some bugs have been fixed.
  Also the logging when performing file transfers has been updated.  
- A new distribution is available: the vlet-sdk. This is a minimized distribution
  containing only the virtual file system (VFS) and a stripped VBrowser without
  any extra plugins which can be used for example inside a (tomcat) web service. 
  
Plugins: 
- The new Moteur plugin (2.0) is available in this release. 

API: 
===
- The VRS/VFS has been cleaned up. Some internal methods have been renamed (old 
  method names have been deprecated) and the (javadoc) documentation has been updated.
- All classes in the legacy 'kbtools' now have 'nl.uva.vlet.kbtools.*' as package
  prefix instead of 'nl.uva.vlet.tools.*' to avoid confusion.    
- DBII interface has been cleaned up and 'public' methods can now be used in 
  in custom plugins.    

=== Release notes for 1.3.1 ===

Please send bug reports, questions or other feedback to: vlet-users@lists.vl-e.nl. 
This list is moderated, so any message from a new sender might take a few days before
it will be accepted. Follow up messages will be automatically accepted.    

This is a bugfix release.

Updates:
===
- Fixed BDII bug (again). The BDII query still relied on the 1.2 Glue scheme to get 1.3 Glue objects. 
  This has been fixed and new Storage Elements should appear under Grid Neighbourhood. 
  

=== Release notes for 1.3.0 ===

Updates: 
===
- Added "Force Delete" for LFC which removes LFC entries even when the status of the 
  replicas can't be determined. 
- Added LB Resources (Logging and Bookkeeping) to GridNeighbourhood. 
  LB Resources also show up as logical childs under WMS Resources. 
- urils.sh script now supports 'listing' of LB resources. 
  The resulting names will be the user jobs as registered at the LB Server. 
- User certificate authentication to grid enabled websites (https) now works.
  After creating a proxy, the user certificate information will be used when
  contacting the remote web site.
- Grid proxy dialog now supports VO Roles and VO Groups. 
  To specify a role, just fill it in at he "VO Role" field.  
  To specify a "VO Group" just use "<VO Name>/<VO Group>" at the VO Name field. 
  For example "pvier/test" (don't use a slash before the VO Name).  
- The implementations of SRM and LFC have been further improved to be robust in 
  the case of errors or temporarily service failures. 
- UserGuide has been updated to include changes from 1.2.0 and 1.3.0.
    
Tools:
===            
- Added JGridStart under "Tools->Grid Utils"
- Added Jython examples for 'urils' and 'lfccp' which can respectively list remote URI
  locations and copy to an LFC location (script includes example how to specify properties.).    
- The scripts uricp.sh,uristat.sh and urils.sh can be used as script interface 
  to the VRS (and VFS).  

API: 
===
- The BDII code has been updated to support the 1.3 Glue schema as well.
  This to support the new PoC update.  
- Updated WMS and LB API now fully available in the VLET API. 
  Experimental job submission and monitoring plugins are available.
  See module: nl.uva.vlet.examples/src/example.vjs.TestSubmit.java    
- https/ssl API has been updated to grid proxies and non grid proxy authentication 
  when setting up https/ssl connections. See SSLContextManager and CertificateStore classes.
  Grid and SSL certificate management has been centralized in one API.  
- GridProxy now can use different proxy providers.   
  The default one is globus (No other proxy providers have been implemented yet).
- ClassLogger API now available which extends java.util.logging.Logger

Plugins:
 - The Computis imzML plugin has been added to the vlet-all distribution. 
     
Bug fixes: 
===
- When copying an LFC file which has more then one replica, under some
  conditions, only one replica was tried. If that failed the copy loop stopped.
  This has been fixed so multiple replicas, if available, will be tried. 
- WMS now correctly queries the LB Services that are associated with that WMS.
- LB Server 2.0 is supported as well.    
- The "Overwrite All" feature from copy dialog didn't work. 
- Logging output/warning statements from LoboBrowser have been reduced. 
- See bugtracker for all bugs.
- The layout of the Grid Proxy dialog has been improved to work better on MacOs.

 1.2.0 Release Notes 
======================================================================
   
New Features
===
- New Grid 'Info' Resource. Really browse the Grid!
  MyVle now shows "Grid Neighbourhood" and "Local System" as parent folders
  for grid resources and local resources. Properties for these resources 
  can be specified. (Right click on the resource and select 'properties').  
- First implementation of WMS prototype. Currently supports Job Monitoring only.  
  Still experimental!
  The WMS API in VLET can be used to create custom WMS Job plugins. 
- Switched from Cobra Toolkit to Lobo Browser which has more (web browsing) 
  features. This also fixes the "505" error when loading .dtd files.    
- New script: urils.sh which can list remote resources. 
  Now the commands "uricopy.sh", "uristat.sh" and "urils.sh" together form 
  a complete scripting interface into the VFS.
- New Copy Dialog asks for options when a target already exists. 
  Added "Skip" feature so that directories can be merged or aborted copy 
  actions can be continued (skipping already existing files). 
- Added multi-select feature: 
   - Press CTRL-A in the IconPanel to select all. 
   - Holding down the SHIFT key lets the user select a range of files.  
- SRM files have a new meta data attribute:"Storage Type".
  For normal files this should be "PERMANENT".  In previous versions the 
  storage type wasn't always set to PERMANENT which could lead to data loss. 
- Added Text Wrapping and Character Encoding settings for TextViewer Plugin.

Disabled
=== 
- SRB Has been phased out.   
  Due to incompatible changes in the API and the fact that SRB isn't used nor supported
  this resource has been disabled. 

Major Bugs fixes (See bugtracker for an overview of all bugs)  
===
- Fixed BDII bug 
- Fixed VOLATILE bug in SRM. By default new created files were marked
  as "VOLATILE". This has been set to "PERMANENT".
- Fixed handling of zero sized LFC Files when replica lengths are not zero.
  Added feature in ReplicaEditor which updates the LFC File size from the 
  replica information. 
- Fixed bug with different username configurations for same SFTP locations. 
- Fixed bug in VBrowser.exe when JAVA_HOME was unspecified.
  (This bug only appeared in alpha versions).

Configuration changes 
===
- see vletrc.prop

Other Issues:
=== 
- Jython installation has been fixed (was broken).  
  Note: Only the vlet-all distribution contains Jython.     

Other
===
- SRM Rewrite. To better maintain the SRM implementation a standalone SRM 
  API has been developed. The VRS now uses this rewritten SRM client.    
  SToRM and CasTor Storage Elements should now be fully supported as well thanks
  to this refactoring.

 Previous 1.1.x Release Notes 
======================================================================
   
=== Release notes for 1.1.4 ===
- Fixed BDII bug 
- Fixed VOLATILE bug in SRM. By default new created files were marked
  as "VOLATILE". This has been set to "PERMANENT".
  
=== Release notes for 1.1.2 ===

This is a bug fix release: 
- SRB was disabled. This has been fixed. 
   
=== Release notes for 1.1.1 ===

This is a bug fix release.  

New Features: 
- added uristat.sh script to query resource attribute likes 
  permissions, size(s) and checksum values (if supported).  
- added -checksum <TYPE> option to uricopy.sh 
- updated 'phicos' VO and added 'dteam' VO information. 
- lib/auxlibs has been cleaned up. Old libraries have been removed.
  Version number information has been added. 
- added bitmap ".bmp" support. 
 
Bugs: 
- SRM Bugs regarding SToRM implementation have been fixed (for biomed SEs). 
- Create VLink bug has been fixed.
- Fixed image load bug in ImageViewer when a URL contains strange characters. 
- Unknown root CA Certificate exceptions are now recognized and an Exception
  with a appropriate error message is thrown to inform the user. 

=== Release notes for 1.1.0 ===

GUI: 
- The VBrowser has new monitoring dialogs. When copying or moving files, a new 
  (Transfer) Monitoring Dialog will appear. 
- When selecting multiple files and dropping them, the copying of the files 
  will be executed one by one and will only show one transfer dialog for all
  the 'dropped' files.    
  In previous releases multiple selected files dropped onto the same 
  resource would trigger multiple transfer dialogs. 

LFC:  
- New Replica Editor. Checksum values and other attributes of individual
  replica's can be inspected as well. 
- LFC Permissions added. 
  Note that Storage Element permissions are handled separately by the SRM services
  and might not honour the permissions as set in the LFC server. 
- Removed 'DefaultVO' option from LFC configuration. Only 'DefaultVORandom' is kept. 
  In practice there is no real difference between DefaultVO and DefaultVORandom.  
- Added menu option "lfc->replicaToPreferred" which recursively replicates a file
  or directory to all storage elements listed in listPreferredSEs. 
- API: VReplicatable interface has been updated with new replica methods which allow
  easy addition/removal of replicas. (See VReplicatable in the VRS package).
    
SRM:
- First implementation of Checksum interface. Checksum values and types can be queried. 
  Use VBrowser Table View and add checksum attributes to inspect checksum values. 
  Which checksum type is used depends on the SRM Implementation. 
  
Miscellaneous:  
- Added TCP time out options for BDII, LFC and SRM. Default value is 30 seconds.
  This speeds up connection attempts to non reachable resources. 
- Added experimental SSH Tunnel configurations for LFC and BDII protocols.     
- Added web proxy configuration for plain HTTP resources. 
  Works with some https services as well.

===========================
Previous 1.0.x Release Notes 
===========================

=== Release notes for 1.0.2 ===
Date: 13 August 2009. 

This is a bug fix release: 
- Fixed bug #284: must ignore exceptions after CLOSEDIR when listing remote 
  LFC directory.  

=== Release notes for 1.0.1 ===
Date: 15 july 2009

This is a bug fix release.

About the release:
=== 
 - vlet-1.0.zip contains VLET "Core" without application plugins.  
 - vlet-all-1.0.zip contains VLET with the VLEMED and AID plugins.
 - vlet-all-gars-1.0.zip contains the GAR files (grid services). 
 Note that the LFC Grid Service is NOT needed anymore to access LFC servers.


Updates:
=== 
- UserGuide has been updated to cover most of the significant changes in 1.0 

Fixed bugs: 
===
- The value of 'replicasNrOfTries' was always reset to 0. This has been fixed. 
- Replicas from SRM V1 Storage Elements can now be read. 
  Storing at a V1 SRM service is still not supported as most storage element support
  a V2.2 interface as well which will be used if available. 
- Under certain conditions uploading a file to an LFC location would try the upload 
  only once instead of the specified 'replicaNrOfTries'.   
- A bug in the parsing or user and domain settings of an SRB location has been 
  fixed which garbled the SRB Server Settings. 
- Under Cygwin the local filesystem implementation would try to use the 'stat' command 
  which failed. This has been disabled.  
- When editing a text using the embedded text editor, the original file permissions would
  be reset. These are now kept. 
- Port numbers have been removed from replicas registered in the LFC server to stay
  compatible with the lcg-* commands.   
- As of VLET 1.0, all JavaGAT libraries and dependencies have been removed. 
  It was never used and no plugins ever have been developed using JavaGAT.  
- See bugtracker for more details about the above bugs. 

=== Release notes for 1.0 ===

Date: 27 May 2009

Features: 
===

VBrowser:
- Added monitoring (still work in progress). Some methods now will 
  display a 'Task Monitor' similar to the already existing "Transfer Dialog".  
- New Properties editor. Shows resource properties in separate tabs. 
 
VRS/VFS:
- New API. See vrs.* and vfs.* classes.
- SSH Passphrase authentication added ! 
  Use ~/.ssh/id_rsa file or change it from the SSH option to point to 
  your SSH key needed for passphrase authentication.   
- LFC: Added New Pure Java implementation for LFC
  - BDII Service is now used to query VO allowed Storage Elements. 
    Replica URIs are automatically matched against these Storage Elements. 
  - Old 'WrapperLFC' is not supported anymore. 
    The grid service has been removed from the gar distribution. 
- Updated SRM driver to work correctly and efficient with LFC.
- Third party copying between GridFTP,SRM and LFC has been updated to 
  work with all possible combinations between them, since the default
  transport protocol used in SRM and LFC is GridFTP. 
- Added transfer monitoring in 3rd party GridFTP transfers. 
 
uricopy.sh: 
- added "-info" and "-mkdirs" option to uricopy.sh script. The latter 
  create the full path of the target directory if not existing yet. 
  Script tested with new LFC driver. Seems to work. 

Other:
 - VLTerm supports more vt100 and xterm codes and is now an almost 
   working terminal emulator. 
 - Image viewer support zoom: double click maximize/minimize and use
   mouse wheel to zoom in/out. 
   
API:  
- Updated Virtual Resource/FileSystem API to "1.0" 
  See JavaDOCs for details. 

Bugs:
===
- Resource Folders now correctly save a multilevel hierarchy of Resource Descriptions. 
- Default SRB and LFC properties were not correctly read from vletrc.prop.
  Use "srb.<server property>=..." and lfc.<server property>=..." to specify 
  installation defaults.  
- Fixed a lot a bugs due to asynchronous browsing. VBrowser panels now can be 
  populated in the background by for example a Query Plug-in without corrupting 
  the internal VBrowser data structure.    
- Fixed DataChannel Authentication mismatch when using third party transfer
  between old (1.x) Grid FTP servers and new (2.x). Needed for true
  3rd party copying between GFTP, SRM and LFC servers. 
- For more bug fixed see the bugtracker.
