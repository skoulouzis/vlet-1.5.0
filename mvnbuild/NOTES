# Maven toplevel build 
#

The maven build isn't finished yet. 
The command "mvn compile" works for the core vlet modules but that is basically it. 

To test this, checkout "mvnbuild" (this module) and "mvndistribution) as sibling projects to the core modules. 
All modules must be in the same directory.
